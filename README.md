# it-journey
a structured overview of my career in tech: from L1 support to LLMs (a bit of chaos included)

---

## 👋 Who I am

Hi, I’m **Karina Lark** (aka **Kai**).  
I’m a tech generalist with a background in **technical support, QA, monitoring, and LLM workflows**.  
Neurodivergent. Driven. Curious. Creative.  
From hardware to prompts, from chaos to clarity. 

---

## 🧩 What’s inside this repo

This portfolio contains selected examples from my work in:

- **L1–L2 technical support** (Avito, Joom, Zvuk B2B, etc.)
- **CI/Monitoring tasks** (Grafana, Jenkins, Graylog, webhooks)
- **QA & testing** (manual, smoke/regression, test cases)
- **LLM prompt design** (Wikibot system prompts, few-shot logic)
- **Documentation** (internal knowledge bases, Confluence)

## 🧠 About me

- 💻 5 years in tech support (B2C → B2B → edge devices)
- 🔁 Cross-functional: worked with DevOps, QA, playback, hardware
- 📊 Proactive: traced incidents, helped to build monitoring, optimized workflows
- 🧪 Curious: learned QA by testing edge devices hands-on
- 🤖 Explored LLM prompting before it was cool.

## 🐾 Fun facts

I also:
- play League of Legends (10k hours as adc main, MT peak - easter egg in the end of README)
- using urbex as my cardio
- write postpunk music and raise two cats.

## 🕹️ Easter Egg: Champion Sheet — Kai, the Neurodivergent Engineer

**Role:** Marksman / Analyst Hybrid  
**Resource:** Focus (instead of Mana)  
**Damage Type:** Mental / True  
**Scaling:** Knowledge + Concentration  
**Origin:** Tech Support Depths  
**Patch:** Pre-PromptOps

### 🧬 Passive — *Overfocus*

Kai builds up Focus by navigating complex systems or documenting bugs no one else can explain.  
If distracted or context-switched, the stack resets — but resumes faster when triggered by anomalies, inconsistencies, or cursed legacy dashboards.

*Enhanced abilities activate automatically when Focus reaches 100%.*

---

### 💡 Q — *Pattern Lock*

Kai highlights invisible structures within chaos: API chains, failing workflows, undocumented triggers.  
Perfect for log diving, error tracing, or identifying mismatched assumptions in client complaints.

*• Enhanced: auto-links incidents to root cause and suggests Confluence anchor.*

---

### 🧪 W — *Debug Dance*

Executes manual probing across systems using smoke tests, user scenarios, and synthetic prompts.  
Each cast increases attention and speeds up bug hypothesis formation.

*• Stackable. At 3 charges, enters "Flow State" — reducing cooldowns and increasing insight radius.*

---

### 🧠 E — *Prompt Mirage*

Summons a well-structured prompt tailored to trick even the most stubborn LLMs.  
Applies few-shot / zero-shot or CoT logic depending on context size.  
Enemies hallucinate bugs. Allies call it wizardry.

*• Can backfire beautifully if model isn’t aligned.*  
*• Enhanced: doubles accuracy of bot-assisted support.*

---

### 🎧 R — *Reality Collapse*  (Ultimate — unlocks at 6 / 11 / 16)

Kai collapses surrounding ambiguity into structure.  
Documentation writes itself. Support workflows optimize. Focus spikes.

At:
- **Level 6**: Analyzes unknown systems with limited data.
- **Level 11**: Connects edge cases to high-level patterns.
- **Level 16**: Sees the architecture behind incidents — and updates the Wiki.

*• Passive bonus: musical damage over time (if headphones are on).*

### 🐾 Champion quotes:

> "I don’t scale. I snowball."  
> "It’s not chaos — it’s undocumented structure."  
> "Stacking Flow. Don’t ping."  
> "One cat runs my cluster. The other manages incident tags."
> "I don’t wait for permission to carry."
