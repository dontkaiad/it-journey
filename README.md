a structured overview of my career in tech: from L1 support to LLMs (a bit of chaos included)

## 👋 Who I am

Hi, I’m **Karina Lark** (aka **Kai**).  
I’m a tech generalist with a background in **technical support, QA, monitoring, and LLM workflows**.  
Neurodivergent. Driven. Curious. Creative.  
From hardware to prompts, from chaos to clarity.
